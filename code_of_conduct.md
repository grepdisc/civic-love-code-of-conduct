Civic Love is a discussion group founded to foster civil dialog about a sustainable future for the Bay Area community.

We value the participation of each member of our community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees within and beyond our monthly discussions.

The Short Version
-----------------

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Civic Love.

Core Principles 
-----------------

Civic Love aims to achieve a sustainable and thoughtful dialog about issues most directly affecting the Bay Area through the following principles.

Civic Love aims to achieve consistent attendance of returning members as well as remaining welcoming to new members.

Civic Love aims to build a safe and hopeful space.

Civic Love recognizes the benefits of balance and diversity. So we aim to nurture group diverse among economic, fields of work, backgrounds, and roles within Bay Area communities.

Civic Love aims to foster and encourage friendships and partnerships outside of our meetings. These connections may be part of the intangible benefits and effects of our group.

Civic Love aims not to add burden to our members, but instead to give an opportunity to meet where 90 minutes of discussion each month is the entire commitment to our group.

Civic Love is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meeting experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of discussion participants in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the group organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or requesting the offender to leave the group.
